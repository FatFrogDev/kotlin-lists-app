# kotlin-lists-app

## Description

This proyect has the intention of showing the adquired abilities to develop Android apps through `Android Studio` and `Kotlin`.
In this case, the app is a simple list of messages with an image.

## Guide to download, build and run the app

- Clone this reposirory `https://github.com/FatFrogDev/kotlin-lists-app.git`
- Using Android Studio (Recomended version: Giraffe | 2022.3.1) open Android Studio, select `open` and indicate where the app location is.
- Once opened, select the `proyect view` and create a new file called `local.properties`. In that file you must indicate the location of your sdk
 directory, here's an example:
- - 'sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\USUARIO\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk'
- Finally select `make proyect` to build it, and run the app through right clicking the `main.kt` file.
